                    <h4>Data Engineer, Star Charge</h4>
                    <h6>Summer 2019</h6>
                    <p>Interned at Star Charge of Wanbang New Energy Investment Group Co Ltd. Company manufactures charging ports for electric vehicles and provides SaaS software</p>
                    <p>
                        Took part in the 828 Low Carbon Emission Campaign to promote environmentally-friendly commute and increase market share. 
                        As competing comapnies realized the huge influx of new users as a result of the campaign,
                        many started to take action and created promotions of their own. My job as a data scientist was to identify the charging stations our competition had seen substantial user growth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most of our competition were software comapnies that operated on our ports, as we were one of the few companies that had both hardware and software.
                         I used SQL programming to run queries to find the stations that had the greatest jump in new users, so our marketing and advertising teams knew the stations to focus on.
                         Our databases included MySQL and Mongo and I had hands-on experience in JDBC, NoSQL and SQL databases.
                    </p>
                    <p> During my free time, I did research into CovanentSQL, a blockchain database and was successful in deploying a CovanentSQL database locally. I also scribed and translated video meetings between foreign companies.</p>
